# HTML Helper package

Initial version. This adds the ability to complete HTML tags by pressing "cmd-opt-."

Currently, this only evaluates the line that the cursor is on.

Next steps will include multi-line evaluation and open/close tag pair highlighting.

Place this in your Atom packages directory: ~/.atom/packages/
