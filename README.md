# HTML Helper package

Initial version. This adds the ability to complete HTML tags by pressing "cmd-opt-."

Currently, this only evaluates the line that the cursor is on and does not account for elements that do not get closed \(like <script>\) or self-close \(like <img />\).

Next steps will include multi-line evaluation, better handling of specific elements, and open/close tag pair highlighting.

Place this in your Atom packages directory: ~/.atom/packages/
